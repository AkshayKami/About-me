        <p>I am Akshay and I am really good at coding and doing other things
            
            I was born in Canada on September/14/2008. So if you are reading this in 2020 Im probably 12 or 13 years old. I really love FOOD AND DRINKS. I dont really have a favorite food or a drink but if I were to live with a food for the rest of my life it would probably be poutine. I just really like the gravy,fries and cheese all mixed together it taste SOOOOO good! I really like to do coding. I started coding in 4rd grade using a website called: https://scratch.mit.edu/ . Now Im in Gr 7 and im using a website called: whitehatjr.com . Throught that website I made soo many cool apps such as: Calculators,Battle games,Educational games even I created wbesites. Also this is how I acualy created this webpage. Its pretty cool right! Now I will Move on to the Hobbies Section! </p>
